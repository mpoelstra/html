# HTML

This repo consists of some HTML exercises. The goal is to work with native modern HTML and use Javascript as little as possible.

Why? Because we often forget the web is evolving and there are new modern native solutions for common ui patterns.

# Exercises

In this repo you will find 4 exercises to play around with some new native HTML features. 

# Http-server

For ease of use you can run `npm install && npm run start` to start a local http server which will serve the exercises. Nothing fancy, so don't expect live reloading :)
